Code of CPMFusion: A Method for Infrared and Visible Image Registration and Fusion Using Modal Correlation

## Tips:<br>
Due to file size issues, the training set has been removed from the code and the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/MSRS
Place the downloaded training dataset under: dataset/train/MSRS path.

## To Train 
Run "** python trainRegFusion.py**" to train your model.
The training data are selected from the MSRS dataset. 

## To Test
Run "**test.py**" to test the model.
The images generated by the test will be placed under the results/Fusion path.
